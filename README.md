# XBOX Game Bar Theme for OBS

While Microsoft's design language is always inconsistent, I wanted OBS to look like the Game Bar. I feel it fit the purpose. I gave it my best effort. QT is limited so I was unable to add things like box shadow and animations. If you find any issues, please let me know.
