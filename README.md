# xbgb-obs

While Microsoft's design language is always inconsistent,
I wanted OBS to look like the Game Bar. I feel it fit
the purpose. I gave it my best effort. QT is limited so
I was unable to add things like box shadow and animations.

*This theme is incomplete!* Many things are impossible to see or use because I have yet to get to everything. Check back later.
